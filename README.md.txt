# SECOM Feature Selection and Model Evaluation

This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline for
feature selection and model evaluation using the SECOM dataset.

The project applies multiple feature selection techniques and evaluates
their impact on classification performance.

## 📌 Feature Selection Methods
- **LASSO (Embedded Method)**
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**
- **RFE with SMOTE**
- **mRMR (Mutual Information based)**

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Linear Regression (thresholded for classification)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Decision Tree
